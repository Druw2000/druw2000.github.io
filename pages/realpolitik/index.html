<h1>Welcome to Realpolitik! A website </h1>
<p>Realpolitik is the body of pragmatic implementations of ideological and moral concerns, thesepolitik. By this definition realpolitik is useless without a theoretical background.</p>
<h3>Realpolitik is not authoritarian.</h3>
<p>Some people may claim realpolitik is a system based soley practicality and is deaf to the concerns of ethics, civics, etc. Do not listen to these people, and disregard <b>everything</b> they say. 'Real' Realpolitik is anything but deaf to <i>important</i> considerations of ethics, civics, etc. because these <i>important</i> considerations are goals loudly proclaimed by <i>important</i> rulers.</p>
<h3>History of Realpolitik</h3>
<p>Funnily enough, the most terrible use of realpolitik, see <a>Nazi Germany</a>, comes from the country which invented it.</p>
