### Chapter 19 - World War I and Beyond
### Section 1 - From Neutrality to War
***
Nationalism and national competition heightened tensions  
* Countries believed in "the people," and disliked the the idea of multiple ethnic groups  
* Old rivalries emerged between France and Germany  
* Social Darwinism helped spread the idea of a single greatest nation through the process of competing nations  
* Empires were threatened beacuse of the new nationalism in their own territories  
* The nations also competed in the same way economically  
Militarism starts arm race  
* Leaders started to advance technologies and expand their armies  
* A spirit of militarism grew because of this  
* These new technologies would change the way wars are fought  
Alliances caused recklessness  
* Alliances also emerged because of the tension  
* Triple Alliance  
    * Germany  
    * Italy  
    * Austria-Hungary  
* Triple Entente  
    * Great Britian  
    * France  
    * Russia  
* Leaders were pondering the benefits of war  
Assassination leads to war  
* In 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife were killed  
* The assassins were Serbians who believed their people had a right to Bosnia  
Allies cause chain reaction  
* Austria-Hungary demanded full cooperation with Serbia after the assassination  
* They were emboldened by Germany's total support  
* After Serbia rejected some of the demands, Austria declared war, and Germany was now involved  
* Russia declared war on Austria-Hungary because Serbia was their ally  
* Germany then declared war on Russia, and France declared war on Germany  
* Germnay declared war on Belgium to attack France through Belgium  
* Great Britain declared war on Germany because France and Belgium were their allies  
* The Central and Allied powers were now formed  
    * Central powers  
        * Germany  
        * Austria-Hungary  
        * Italy (left early)  
        * Ottoman Empire (joined later)  
    * Allied Powers  
        * Great Britain  
        * France  
        * Belgium  
        * Russia  
        * Serbia  
* The French and British stopped the advancing Germans at the Marne river  
Deadly techonology leads to stalemate  
* The Germans fortified positions on high ground and dug trenches  
* When enemies would approach they would blown apart by artillery and razed with machine guns  
* This killed thousands  
* The Allies used the same tactic against the Axis though and many thousands would be killed  
* The superiority of defensive weapons over offensive weapons caused a long, deadly, tragic stalemate  
* The collection of trenches and artillery stretched from Belgium to Switzerland and was called "The Western Front"  
Wilson urges neutrality  
* The "melting pot" assumption caused many mixed feelings within the US  
* In 1914 one-third of Americans were foreign-born  
* Germans and such supported Central powers  
* English and such support Allied powers  
* The invasion of Belgium caused many Americans to rethink intervention  
Neutrality gives way to war  
* Britain blockades Germany and expands their definition of "contraband"  
* Unrestricted German submarine warfare caused opinion on intervention to change  
* Congress passes National Defense Act, and Naval Construction Act which were steps toward militarism  
* Eventually after the sinking of the Lustitania and Sussex, Wilson had to go to war
