<strong>Intelligence:</strong> the ability to undestand complex ideas and solve problems, to adapt, effectively to the environment, to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, and to overcome obstacles.<br />
<strong>Intelligence tests:</strong> tests for assessing a personâ€™s mental abilities and comparing them with the abilities of others, by means of a numerical score.<br />
* Should these tests be used to rank people? Are the answers hereditary or environmental.<br />
** Theories of Intelligence:**<br />
* fluid intelligence is ability to think logically without needing previously learned knowledge, and crystallized intelligence requires specific learned knowledge.<br />
* Are there multiple intelligences, or is there one intelligence?<br />
* Charles Spearman, general intelligence<br />
* Howard Gardner, eight intelligences<br />
* Robert Sternberg, three intelligences<br />
* Spearman proposed that general intelligence is linked to many clusters that can be analyzed by factor analysis<br />
** Factor analysis:** a process in which the values of observed data are expressed as functions of a number of possible causes in order to find which are the most important.<br />
* Howard Gardner supports the idea that intelligence comes in multiple forms.<br />
** Savant syndrome:** condition in which a person has a high ability in one area, and is handicapped in all others.</p>
